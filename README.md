## Sampling Techniques

We have experimented with the following sampling techniques to handle imbalanced data:

- **SMOTEENN**: Combines over-sampling using SMOTE and under-sampling using Edited Nearest Neighbors.
- **NearMiss**: Under-sampling technique that selects examples from the majority class whose average distance to the nearest examples from the minority class is the smallest.
- **RandomOverSampler**: Over-sampling technique that randomly replicates examples from the minority class.

## Machine Learning Models

We have trained the following machine learning models for fraud detection:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

## Results and Discussion

We have analyzed the performance of each model with different sampling techniques and compared their accuracy scores. Detailed results and discussions can be found in our project notebooks and result files.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
